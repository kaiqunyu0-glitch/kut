* I have downloaded the paper and processed the deta,the deta processing progress is currently 4%
## 2026-2-12
* Although my laptop shut down due to a power issue,The deta processing is currently 41% and i change code to prevent recurrence.
## 2026-2-13
* The deta processing is currently 77%
* I messed up and accidentally terminated the process with Ctrl+C. We are now shifting our training environment to Kaggle to leverage its GPU resources.
## 2026-2-14
